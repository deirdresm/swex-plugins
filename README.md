# A couple of small [SW-Exporter](https://github.com/Xzandro/sw-exporter) Plugins

1. Duplicate the swarfarm plugin to also push to a local instance. Called, shockingly, swarfarm-dev.
2. Guild logger including guild wars, siege wars, and labyrinth commands. Note: this isn't creating a clever CSV file at this point. Still trying to get more samples of the responses for future design.
3. Dimension Hole command logger to look at dimension hole battle results. As with guild logger, just looking for future design at the moment.
